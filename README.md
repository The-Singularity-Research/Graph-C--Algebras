### Pullbacks and tensor products of Graph-C*-Algebras for quantum information
Notes and an implementation of pullback/fibre products and the corresponding relative tensor products of Leavitt and Graph C*-algebras important for modeling entanglement of cyclic quantum harmonic oscillators. 

$$\otimes_{max}, \otimes_{min},$$ and C*-norms...

### Hilbert-Polya implies Yang-Mills Mass Gap
Question 1: Why does a physical (quantum) implementation of the spectral properties of Artin L-functions via a quantum Hamiltonian give a mathematical theory of the gaps between Eigenstates and their corresponding Eigenvalues?
Question 2: How do we explain the "bounded below property" of energy in conformal field theories?

### Gluing Linear Graphs to get Cycle Graphs
Expand on the explanation of using order to glue the ends of linear quivers to get cycle quivers to relate the algebras $M_n(\mathbb{C})$ and $M_n(C(S^1))$, and to explain how $A_{\infty}$ (compact operators) fits into the picture. See "Surface Algebras III" section on the quadratic extension $\mathbb{Q}(i)/\mathbb{Q}$. Also consider linear quiver product with $\mathbb{Z}$. Another way of phrasing this is in terms of covering theory of the $\mathbb{A}_{\infty}$ quiver giving the algebra of compact operators $\mathbf{Mat}_{\infty}(\mathbb{C})$, and the cyclic quivers of type $\tilde{\mathbb{A}}_n$ giving graph $C^*$-algebras $\mathbf{Mat}_n(C(S^1))$ (where we consider $S^1$ as an algebraic variety if necessary).
